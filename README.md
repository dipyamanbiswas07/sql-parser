# Sql Parser

### Introduction about the project

This is a web application to enable a user to query a SQL DB. A user can either type the query or Select it from a prefilled list.

### Major Plugins/Libraries

I chose Vue.js for the front end and used Vuetify as the UI library.

#### Performance

The page render takes around 1.25 secs. I measured it using Lighthouse in the chrome dev tools.

As part of performance improvements I did optimise the components to not cause a lot of rerenders. More could be done on reducing the bundle size.
